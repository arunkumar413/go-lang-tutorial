Go language tutorial


```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
   /* This is my first sample program. */
   fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

The example above shows a simple go program.
The statement `package main` declares the program that we're writing as main package.
The statement `import "fmt" ` imports a package called fmt. fmt is an inbuilt package of go language.
The line `fmt.Println("Hello, World!")` uses the Println method of fmt package to print the string "Hello world" to the console.
